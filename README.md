# Features 

## Existing features

### Navigation bar

- The navigation bar contains a logo to the left, picturing a door to a dungeon, the name of the bar and on smaller screens (up to 768px) a "burger" menu to the right. Clicking the the "burger" menu toggles a menu of links to the home page, games page and book a table page. To make the navigation bar responsive, on screens bigger than 768px the links are placed by convention to the right for the user. The logo and menu links also increases in size as the screensize increases. The navigation bar is visible on all three pages.
- To show when a user is on a page, the page link underlines then the page is active. To indicate where the user are on the site. 
- When the mouse hovers over a page link, the page link underlines to indicate to the user that it is a link.

# Planning and design
The site was planned and designed according to the user stories and wireframes below. 
With images chosen to allude to board gaming, to be inviting to the potential users/customers. The color scheme of #ff5733 and #3a3a3a were chosen also to be inviting and warm. With the charcoal/black color to most text for good contrast and orange color for warmth and playfullness. 

The font chosen is Raleway from Google fonts, it was chosen as it is relatively simple and not to complex, but still conveying a feeling suitable with board games. Especially based on the way "W" is shaped, giving a hint of a medieval font, in line with the role playing theme in the bars name.  

Some changes were made to the original design in the wireframes, they are as follows.
- Contact page were changed to book a table, to simplify and clarify the purpose of the page. With advice from my mentor. 
- On the games page, the form for suggesting a game to add to the collection was removed. To be able to finish the project in time. The form for suggestion of games was added to future features instead. 
- The events are more vertically spread out on tablet and mobile screen size.
